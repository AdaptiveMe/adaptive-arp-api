# Adaptiveware Core Interfaces (Objective-C)

##### This repository contains the Adaptiveware Core Interfaces for the Objective-C (iOS) language. 

The code in this repository is sourced and generated semi-automatically from [here](https://github.com/Adaptiveware/adaptiveware-core-interfaces-java). These interfaces and implementation are staging code for device specific implementations.

===

## Introduction

Adaptiveware interfaces are defined in Java and transliterated to the different language domains that the platform provides. The goal of this is to ensure that all interfaces are in-sync with what's being done on the Java platform - specific implementations of these interfaces are implemented in the conventional wayâ€¦ using software engineering skill.

## Drive It!

The code generation from Java to Objective-C is done using [j2objc](https://code.google.com/p/j2objc/) licensed under Apache Public License v2.0. This directory contains the tool-set used for the translation along with a Makefile to facilitate the regeneration of bindings. 

Steps to generate and compile the code:

1. If you're not on a Mac OSX, stop here. Otherwise, goto 2.
2. Run './configure.sh'.
3. Run 'make generate' to create the Objective-C code.
	* *The make script automatically checks out the latest release version of the Java code.*
4. If the code was generated, you should have a new directory at "../adaptiveware-".
5. Run 'make compile' to compile the generated code.
6. That's all folks! You should have .o in the "../adaptiveware-" directory.

You can clean-up all generated artefacts using:

* Run 'make clean' and 'make cleanall' to clean-up.
* After running 'make cleanall' you'll have to start with the aforementioned point 2.
