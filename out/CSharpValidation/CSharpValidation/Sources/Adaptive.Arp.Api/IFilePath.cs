     /**
        An object that may be used to locate a file in a file system. It will
typically represent a system dependent file path.
<p> A {@code Path} represents a path that is hierarchical and composed of a
sequence of directory and file name elements separated by a special separator
or delimiter. A <em>root component</em>, that identifies a file system
hierarchy, may also be present. The name element that is <em>farthest</em>
from the root of the directory hierarchy is the name of a file or directory.
The other name elements are directory names. A {@code Path} can represent a
root, a root and a sequence of names, or simply one or more name elements.
A {@code Path} is considered to be an <i>empty path</i> if it consists
solely of one name element that is empty. Accessing a file using an
<i>empty path</i> is equivalent to accessing the default directory of the
file system. {@code Path} defines the {@link #getFileName() getFileName},
{@link #getParent getParent}, {@link #getRoot getRoot}, and  methods to access
the path components or a subsequence of its name elements.
<p> In addition to accessing the components of a path, a {@code Path} also
defines the {@link #resolvePath(IFilePath) resolve} and {@link #resolveSiblingPath(IFilePath)
resolveSibling} methods to combine paths. The {@link #relativize relativize}
method that can be used to construct a relative path between two paths.
Paths can be, and tested against each other using
the {@link #startsWith startsWith} and {@link #endsWith endsWith} methods.
<p> <b>WARNING:</b> This interface is only intended to be implemented by
those developing custom file system implementations. Methods may be added to
this interface in future releases. </p>
<h2>Accessing Files</h2>
<p> Paths may be used with the {@link IFile} class to operate on files,
directories, and other types of files. For example, suppose we want a {@link
java.io.BufferedReader} to read text from a file "{@code access.log}". The
file is located in a directory "{@code logs}" relative to the current working
directory and is UTF-8 encoded.
<pre>
    Path path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("logs", "access.log");
    BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
</pre>
<h2>Concurrency</h2>
<p> Implementations of this interface are immutable and safe for use by
multiple concurrent threads.
